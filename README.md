# Maji Ndogo Water Project â€“ Part 4 (Power BI)

## Overview  
This project is part of the Maji Ndogo water initiative. Using Power BI, I prepared and visualized updated data so both the public and decision-makers can track project progress, spending, and impact.  

## Steps I took to prepare the data  
1. **Updated the dataset**  
   - Replaced Excel files with the latest version.  
   - Adjusted Power Query settings to keep reports connected.  

2. **Cleaned and transformed data**  
   - Fixed location updates (towns and provinces).  
   - Corrected DAX calculations for budgeted costs.  
   - Checked new fields like dates, costs, and vendor IDs.  

3. **Built relationships**  
   - Connected water sources, project progress, and vendors.  
   - Added the **Vendors** table for extra context.  

4. **Created measures**  
   - Progress metrics: completed projects, % complete, remaining sources.  
   - Population metrics: access to water now vs after improvements.  
   - Financial metrics: cumulative budget and costs.  
   - Optimized calculations for performance.  

5. **Designed visuals**  
   - Map of project status by town and rural/urban split.  
   - KPI visuals comparing budgeted vs actual costs over time.  
   - Cards and tooltips for key stats.  
   - Charts breaking down spending by type, location, and vendor.  

6. **Analysis and updates**  
   - Tracked progress (22% complete, access improved from 34% to 48%).  
   - Identified overspending (10% over budget).  
   - Found rural projects nearly twice as expensive as urban.  
   - Used Key Influencers visuals to explain cost drivers.  
   - Compared vendors to highlight cost differences.  

7. **Dashboard cleanup**  
   - Polished titles, tooltips, and layouts for clarity.  
   - Ensured visuals work for both public transparency and leadership needs.  

## Skills applied  
- Power Query for cleaning and transforming data  
- Data modeling and relationship management  
- DAX for progress, access, and financial tracking  
- Performance optimization with measures  
- Analytical thinking to explain overspending  
- Dashboard design with clear, interactive visuals  

## Dashboard goals  
- Show project progress at national, provincial, and town levels  
- Track and compare budget vs actual spending  
- Display changes in access to water  
- Break down costs by type, location  
- Support both public transparency and decision-making
